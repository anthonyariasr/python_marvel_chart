This was made as a practice to test mathplotlib and pandas for data visualization, the data set was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darrylljk/marvel-cinematic-universe-films-box-office.


In order to run this you will have to install both libraries using 
"pip install mathplotlib" and "pip install pandas".
